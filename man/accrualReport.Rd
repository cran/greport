\arguments{
\item{formula}{formula object, with time variables on the left (separated by +) and grouping variables on the right.  Enrollment date, randomization date, region, country, and site when present must have the variables in parenthesis preceeded by the key words \code{enrollment, randomize, region, country, site}.}

\item{data}{data frame.}

\item{subset}{a subsetting epression for the entire analysis.}

\item{na.action}{a NA handling function for data frames, default is \code{na.retain}.}

\item{dateRange}{\code{Date} or character 2-vector formatted as \code{yyyy-mm-dd}.  Provides the range on the \code{x}-axis (before any zooming).}

\item{zoom}{\code{Date} or character 2-vector for an option zoomed-in look at accrual.}

\item{targetN}{integer vector with target sample sizes over time, same length as \code{targetDate}}

\item{targetDate}{\code{Date} or character vector corresponding to \code{targetN}}

\item{closeDate}{\code{Date} or characterstring.  Used for randomizations per month and per site-month - contains the dataset closing date to be able to compute the number of dates that a group (country, site, etc.) has been online since randomizating its first subject.}

\item{enrollmax}{numeric specifying the upper y-axis limit for cumulative enrollment when not zoomed}

\item{minrand}{integer.  Minimum number of randomized subjects a country must have before a box plot of time to randomization is included.}

\item{panel}{character string.  Name of panel, which goes into file base names and figure labels for cross-referencing.}

\item{h}{numeric.  Height of ordinary plots, in inches.}

\item{w}{numeric.  Width of ordinary plots.}

\item{hb}{numeric.  Height of extended box plots.}

\item{wb}{numeric.  Weight of extended box plots.}

\item{hdot}{numeric.  Height of dot charts in inches.}

\details{
Typically the left-hand-side variables of the formula, in order, are date of enrollment and date of randomization, with subjects enrolled but not randomized having missing date of randomization.  Given such date variables, this function generates cumulative frequencies optionally with target enrollment/randomization numbers and with time-zooming.  Makes a variety of dot charts by right-hand-side variables:  number of subjects, number of sites, number of subjects per site, fraction of enrolled subjects randomized, number per month, number per site-month.
