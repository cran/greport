\usage{
eReport(formula, data = NULL, subset = NULL, na.action = na.retain,
  minincidence = 0, conf.int = 0.95, etype = "adverse events",
  panel = "events", subpanel = NULL, head = NULL, tail = NULL, h = 6,

}
\arguments{
  \item{formula}{a formula with one or two left hand
  variables (the first representing major categorization
  and the second minor), and 1-2 right hand variables.  One
  of these may be enclosed in \code{id()} to indicate the
  presence of a unique subject ID, and the other is
  treatment.}

  \item{data}{input data frame}

  \item{subset}{subsetting criteria}

  \item{na.action}{function for handling \code{NA}s when
  creating analysis frame}

  \item{minincidence}{a number between 0 and 1 specifying
  the minimum incidence in any stratum that must hold
  before an event is included in the summary}

  \item{conf.int}{confidence level for difference in
  proportions}

  \item{etype}{a character string describing the nature of
  the events, for example \code{"adverse events"},
  \code{"serious adverse events"}.  Used in figure
  captions.}

  \item{panel}{panel string}

  \item{subpanel}{a subpanel designation to add to
  \code{panel}}

  \item{head}{character string.  Specifies initial text in
  the figure caption, otherwise a default is used.}

  \item{tail}{a character string to add to end of automatic
  caption}

  \item{h}{height of graph}

  \item{w}{width of graph}

  \item{append}{set to \code{TRUE} if adding to an existing
  sub-report}

  \item{popts}{a list of options to pass to graphing
  functions}

\description{
Generates graphics for binary event proportions
}
\details{
Generates dot charts showing proportions on left and risk
difference with confidence intervals on the right, if there
is only one level of event categorization.  Input data must
contain one record per event, with this record containing
the event name.  If there is more than one event of a given
type per subject, unique subject ID must be provided.
Denominators come from \code{greport} options and it is
assumed that only randomized subjects have records.  Some
of the graphics functions are modifications of those found
in the HH package.  The data are expected to have one
record per event, and non-events are inferred from
\code{setgreportOption('denom')}.  It is also assumed that
only randomized subjects are included in the dataset.
