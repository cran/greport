\usage{
nriskReport(formula, groups = NULL, data = NULL, subset = NULL,
  na.action = na.retain, ylab = "Number Followed", panel = "nrisk",
  head = NULL, tail = NULL, h = 5.5, w = 5.5, outerlabels = TRUE,
  append = FALSE, popts = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{a formula with time and the left hand side, and with variables on the right side being possible stratification variables.  If no stratification put \code{1} as the right hand side.  Specify unique subject IDs by including a term \code{id()} if subjects have more than one observation.}

\item{groups}{a character string naming a superpositioning variable.  Must also be included in \code{formula}.}

\item{data}{data frame}

\item{subset}{a subsetting epression for the entire analysis}

\item{na.action}{a NA handling function for data frames, default is \code{na.retain}}

\item{ylab}{character string if you want to override \code{"Number Followed"}}

\item{panel}{character string.  Name of panel, which goes into file base names and figure labels for cross-referencing.  The default is \code{'nrisk'}.}

\item{head}{character string.  Specifies initial text in the figure caption, otherwise a default is used}

\item{tail}{optional character string.  Specifies final text in the figure caption, e.g., what might have been put in a footnote in an ordinary text page.  This appears just before any needles.}

\item{h}{numeric.  Height of plot, in inches}

\item{w}{numeric.  Width of plot}

\item{outerlabels}{logical that if \code{TRUE}, pass \code{lattice} graphics through the \code{latticeExtra} package's \code{useOuterStrips}function if there are two conditioning (paneling) variables, to put panel labels in outer margins.}

\item{append}{logical.  Set to \code{FALSE} to start a new panel}

\item{popts}{list specifying extra arguments to pass to \code{Ecdf}.  A common use is for example \code{popts=list(layout=c(columns,rows))} to be used in rendering \code{lattice} plots.  \code{key} and \code{panel} are also frequently used.}

\description{
Graph number of subjects at risk
}
\details{
\code{nriskReport} generates multi-panel charts, separately for categorical analysis variables.  Each panel depicts the number at risk as a function of follow-up time.  The Hmisc \code{Ecdf} function is used.  Stratification is by treatment or other variables.  It is assumed that this function is only run on randomized subjects.
