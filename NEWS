Changes in version 0.5-2 (2014-11-21)

   * survReport: changed to use npsurv instead of survfit.formula

   * exReport: fine tuning
   * nriskReport: new report to show number of subjects still being followed at each day

   * accrualReport: improved graphics formatting, added minrand argument
   * accrualReport: added enrollmax argument, clarified notation
   * exReport: added ignoreExcl, ignoreRand arguments
   * all: added greportOption texwhere; default is 'gentex'; can specify texwhere='' to write non-appendix LaTeX code to console as for knitr
   * dReport: for byx for discrete Y, sense when Y is binary and use Wilson interval instead of bootstrap; adjust SE using confidence interval if proportion is 0 or 1
   * dReport: changed discreteness non-binary classification to use maximum number of unique values or Y instead of minimum
   * add globalVariables call to nriskReport
